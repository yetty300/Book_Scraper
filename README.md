# Python Book Scraper Program
This is a beginner/intermediate friendly program that pulls data from the website http:books.toscrape.com and uploads it as an excel doc for readability. 
This project will help you learn how to read HTML and use a couple of different Python Packages (BeautifulSoup, OS, requests, csv ...). 
The project does require a basic understanding of the python programming language such as how to make lists and use loops. I highly recommend reviewing the documentation and trying a couple of exercises on replit if needed.

## Setting up the IDE
To get started with this project you will have to go to [(https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)] version 3.12 and download the program for your given operating system. 
You will also have to download python from [(https://www.python.org/downloads/}] version 3.12.1 for your specific operating system. 
Once pycharm is installed, open it and you will create a new project and can copy and paste this code or use git to link the code to your project.

### The Program
This program pulls data from the website [(http://books.toscrape.com)] and organizes it into various categories to be exported to CSV/excel files for easy viewing and organizing. 
The pieces of data it retrieves for each book are: title, URL, UPC, price w/tax and without, description, category, rating and image URL and images. 
It organizes these pieces of data into multiple excel files by category. The reason for this program is it makes viewing relevant pieces of data from a entire website straightforward and quick. 
Instead of scrolling through page after page of books all that data is assembled for you to easily search through. 
It eliminates the time component and retrieves a vast amount of data which can help you quickly find the necessary data that you need regarding whatever book you are trying to find. 
This project can be adapted for future projects to scrape a number of different websites (please make sure that you can do so legally)
